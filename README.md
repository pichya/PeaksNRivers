## Summary
Peaks and Rivers is our submission to Colorado Lottery Game Jam Submission. It represents a prototype for a Monitor type lottery game where players can fill out a form before each game and wager on how many turns it will take to reach the end, how many ladders and rivers taken, the grid square numbers on the 10th and 20th turns...etc. The visual theme and design is inspired by the scenic geography of the Colorado mountains and rivers.

Towering, snow-capped mountains, waterfall hikes, natural hot springs tucked into valleys, golden galaxies of aspen trees in the fall—Colorado is a scenic geographic wonder.

The Snakes and Ladders represented Vice and Virtue a

## Technology / Game Assets Used
Peaks and Rivers was developed in Unity 3D version 2019.3.14. We decided to use an isometric camera view for the game screen to better enhance the gameboard design and player's ascent to the top. Inserting Low Poly Assets into the environment graphics is less distracting than high-resolution graphics and keeps the focus on the gameplay. The Unity Asset Store was the source for all the (Free!) Game Assets used inside the game.
